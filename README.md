### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an iOS App and framework developer. Currently venturing into ML & AI and Data science.

### ML & AI demos with TDD:
- [A simple KNN model is built using KDTree to demonstrate house appraisals.](https://github.com/raditz2488/knn-houseappraisal.git)

### EDA:
- [An assignment to analyse global investment options for an AMC.](https://github.com/raditz2488/EDA-InvestmentAssignment.git)

### Reinforcement Learning assignments:
- [A Deep RL agent to maximise profit for a Cab driver with a simplistic environment](https://github.com/raditz2488/RL-CabDriver.git)
- [An assignment to demonstrate Reinforced Learnong of an Numerical TicTacToe agent.](https://github.com/raditz2488/RL-TicTacToeAgent.git)

### Flask demo apps:
- [A simple flask application, hosting a neural network model to predict miles per gallon given the features of the car. An API is provided as an endpoint to pass the attributes of a car.](https://github.com/raditz2488/Flask-hosting-MilesPerGallonApproximation.git)
- [A flask application, hosting the MobileNet model to recognize images. This application provides a web interface to upload an image for recognition.](https://github.com/raditz2488/Flask-ImageRecognition.git)
